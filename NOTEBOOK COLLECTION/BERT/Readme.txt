### 3. **Custom Named Entity Recognition with BERT (Only First WordPiece)**

```markdown
# Custom Named Entity Recognition with BERT (First WordPiece)

This notebook demonstrates a variant of NER training where only the first WordPiece token is considered for each word. It includes:
- Data preprocessing to focus on first WordPiece tokens.
- Fine-tuning BERT on the modified dataset.

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: PyTorch, Transformers, Datasets

### Usage
Use this notebook for NER tasks where only the first WordPiece is used for token labeling.
