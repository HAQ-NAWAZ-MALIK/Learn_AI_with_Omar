# Conditional DETR: Fine-Tuning and Inference

## Overview
This project includes two Jupyter notebooks for working with Conditional DETR, a state-of-the-art object detection model:

1. **Fine-tuning Conditional DETR**: This notebook shows how to fine-tune the Conditional DETR model on a custom dataset.
2. **Inference with Conditional DETR**: This notebook demonstrates how to use the fine-tuned model to make predictions.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required dependencies (install via `requirements.txt`)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use
- **Fine-tune the model**: Open `Fine_tuning_Conditional_DETR_on_custom_dataset_(balloon).ipynb` and follow the instructions to fine-tune the model.
- **Run inference**: Open `Run_inference_with_Conditional_DETR.ipynb` and follow the steps to run predictions on your dataset.
