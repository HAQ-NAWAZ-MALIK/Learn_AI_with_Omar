This notebook dives into the **BEiT (Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers)** model for masked image modeling tasks.

### Features
- Explores the BEiT architecture.
- Implements masked image modeling.
- Demonstrates the use of a pre-trained BEiT model.

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: PyTorch, Transformers, NumPy, Matplotlib

### Usage
Run this notebook to experiment with the BEiT model for understanding and fine-tuning masked image modeling tasks.
